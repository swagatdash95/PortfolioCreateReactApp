# PortfolioCreateReactApp


This is a React project to create my protfolio. This was created using npx create-react-app utility. Webpack config and babel config come integrated as part of the utility. Hosting the same was done to firebase. This being a static website, didnt need any firebase functions to be used. Was a plain deployment to firebase.
https://portfolioswagat.web.app/ Can be used to check it in runtime.
